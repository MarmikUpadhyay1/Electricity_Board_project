# **Electricity Board Project (Confidential)**

## **Project Overview**

This project involved the automation of critical processes for an Electricity Board, focusing on data extraction, comparison, and decision-making. The solution leveraged reusable meta-bots to streamline operations and enhance decision accuracy. The automation framework handled whether a user connection would be **Offered**, **Rejected**, or sent for **Further Inspection**, based on real-time data analysis. The project lifecycle included POC, design, documentation, development, deployment, Hypercare support, and final handover to the client with detailed documentation.

## **Key Features**

1. **Data Extraction and Comparison**  
   - Automated extraction of data from the Electricity Board's website.  
   - Compared the extracted data with new incoming records to detect discrepancies and trigger appropriate actions.  

2. **Decision-Making Workflow**  
   - Designed an automated decision-making system to classify user connections into:
     - **Offer**: Approve the connection.  
     - **Reject**: Deny the connection.  
     - **Further Inspection**: Flag for manual review or additional checks.  

3. **Reusable Meta-Bots**  
   - Developed reusable meta-bots for repetitive tasks to ensure scalability and maintainability.  
   - Enabled seamless integration with other workflows, reducing development time for similar processes.  

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**  
   - Delivered Solution Design Documents (SDD), Process Design Documents (PDD), and Handover Documents to the client for smooth knowledge transfer.  

5. **Hypercare Support**  
   - Provided post-deployment Hypercare support to ensure system stability and address initial issues.

1. **Proof of Concept (POC)**  
   - Demonstrated the feasibility of automating data extraction, comparison, and decision-making.  
   - Obtained client approval after presenting the POC.  

2. **Design and Development**  
   - Designed the automation framework to handle complex workflows with reusable meta-bots.  
   - Developed workflows to automate data validation and decision-making processes.  

3. **Testing and Deployment**  
   - Conducted unit and integration testing to ensure reliability and performance.  
   - Deployed the system in a live environment with minimal operational disruption.  

4. **Hypercare and Handover**  
   - Monitored system performance during the Hypercare phase to fine-tune the solution.  
   - Prepared and handed over comprehensive documentation to the client for future maintenance.
